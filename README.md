DBGUI is a MySQL and PostgreSQL GUI implemented using the Python ncurses library. 
It provides a simple, streamlined interface for users to interact with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

To use it, simply invoke the CursesDatabase.py script. The program will provide wizards for the user to perform most of the common actions.

Otherwise, the user can query the database directly within the program.
